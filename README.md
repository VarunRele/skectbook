## Canvas to draw Number and to predict its value

Requires pygame-ce to run.

Draw a number in the black screen. On the side it will show confident the model to a given number.

Note: Model takes input of 28 * 28 tensor. 

Current model is not great. Need to improve further by providing much variation in trianing samples.
